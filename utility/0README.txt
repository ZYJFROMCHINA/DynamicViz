Political boundary data files are stored in this directory. I used the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT, http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/) to extract boundary data. 

A bash script (get_boundaries.sh) is included as an example. If you want to use this tool for other regions, you may need to change parameters in the bash script.

The License.txt is the license of GMT.
