Since GitHub doesn't allow files larger than 10mb, the HTML files are compressed and split into smaller chucks when necessary. To unzip WUS_model_viewer.zip, you may use the following command in your Terminal. 
	unzip WUS_model_viewer.zip
To recover the HTML file from WUS_cross_section_viewer.zip.partaa and WUS_cross_section_viewer.zip.partaa, you may use the commands below:
	cat WUS_cross_section_viewer.zip.part* > WUS_cross_section_viewer.zip
	unzip WUS_cross_section_viewer.zip
