Rayleigh-Wave Group Velocity Observations

Dispersion data in this directory were processed by Herrmann, R. B., C. J. Ammon and H. Benz (2013). If you use these dispersion curves for research, please cite the data as the following:

Herrmann, R. B., C. J. Ammon and H. Benz (2013). Group velocity dispersion for North America, http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqc_research/NATOMO.

Rayleigh-Wave phase velocities and Love-wave measurements can be found on the webpage as well. The original package also provides tools to extract dispersion curves at any point of interest.

The file per.uniq stores the period for each of the dispersion maps (vs_0XX_001.xyz). 

Four columns in the dispersion map files are latitude, longitude, group velocity, and ray path length. We only use dispersion values that have ray path length greater than 50 km.
