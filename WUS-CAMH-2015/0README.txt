3D Shear Velocity Models

The 3D shear velocity models from Chai et al. (2015) are used as an example for interactive visualization. If you use the models for research, please cite the data as the following:

Chai, C., C. J. Ammon, M. Maceira, and R. B. Herrmann (2015), Inverting interpolated receiver functions with surface wave dispersion and gravity: Application to the western U.S. and adjacent Canada and Mexico, Geophysical Research Letters, 42(11), 4359â€“4366, doi:10.1002/2015GL063733.

You can also find the model on the following webpages.

2015GL063733-ds01.txt is the initial model.
2015GL063733-ds02.txt is the inverted model that is constrained by smoothed/interpolated P-wave receiver functions, Rayleigh-wave group velocity and gravity observations.
